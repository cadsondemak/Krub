Krub
Old fashion text face with a little twist. Krub is using the modern structure of Thai traditional loop with a touch of the traditional text face from hot metal type era. This typeface is one of the most popular choices among the graphic designers who are looking for a sweet spot of less dusty traditional Thai typeface. The disconnected Thai loop design is the standout characteristic of this typeface. Krub captures the sense of politeness and classic old style without making the page looks out of date. The font was originally designed by Ekaluck Peanpanawate
